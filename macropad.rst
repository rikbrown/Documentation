Getting Started with the MacroPad
=================================

Macro Pages
***********

The MacroPad currently allows you to set 6 pages of macros, and each macro can be 1-3 keys. This is great if you want to be able to switch between several productivity-oriented programs that use keyboard shortcuts. It can also be used to switch between work and game profiles, and even multiple games if they use different keys. You can also get more creative and use AutoHotKey (on Windows) to do even more with your macros.

Side Button
***********

By quickly pressing the side button, it will function as a simple escape key. If you hold it until the LED blinks white, you can press one of the 6 keys to switch between the 6 pages.

RGB LED
*******

The LED serves a few purposes. Most of the time, it's going to show you the active page represented by a color. It will blink when you hold the side button down to show you that it's ready to change pages, and it will cycle when you open the remapper.
