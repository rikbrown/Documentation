*************
There are two things that should be done before you use your keypad.

Installing the Keycaps

To install the keycaps, put them on top of the switches in the correct orientation and push them down.

O-rings come pre-installed on the keycaps so there is no need to isntall them manually. If you don't like the soft feel and reduced travel of the keys, they can be removed.

Remove Tape Film

The tape on the bottom of the keypad will fix it to your desk so it doesn't move around during play. This tape has a film covering it that must be removed to expose its stickiness.

***************
These are some other things you can do after you get your keypad up and running.

Setting the LED mode
````````````````````
While the basic model's side button is used exclusively as an escape key, it serves an additional purpose on all models with LEDs. By holding the button down and waiting for the LEDs to blink, you can change the LED mode. Wait for it to blink twice for the secondary action, which is for changing the brightness (or the colors on the custom mode.) For more info on LED modes and the side button for your keypad, please visit the models page here:

Remapping and Reprogramming
```````````````````````````
If you're unhappy with the default zx(cv) button mapping of your keypad, visit this page to learn how to easily remap the buttons!

`How to remap the buttons on your keypad. <http://docs.thnikk.moe/en/latest/remap.html>`_

If you'd like to change the functionality of the keypad, I have a reprogramming guide that you can visit here.

If you wish for any aditionaly functionality, I would appreciate it if you opened an issue on my GitHub.
