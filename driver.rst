Driver Installation
===================

Windows 8.1 or lower
********************

Before we get started with any remapping or programming, you'll need the driver for the keypad installed.

`Adafruit Drivers <https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Windows_Drivers/releases/download/2.2.0/adafruit_drivers_2.2.0.0.exe>`_

You can install all of the drivers if you'd like, but only the "Feather 32u4, Feather M0, Feather M0 Express..." option is necessary.

For keypads purchased before 3/15/18
------------------------------------

`Arduino Leonardo Drivers <http://puu.sh/tg52G/f1255ee469.zip>`_

Download and extract the zip to your desktop and open "dpinst-amd64.exe." Follow the wizard and say yes when it asks. That's it!


Windows 10, Mac, and Linux
**************************

No driver installation required. You're done, great job!
