Summary
=======

About a month before Future Tone came out, I really wanted a controller for the game. I had just bought my PS4 and was planning on getting my first 3D printer. I decided to try to make an arcade-style controller using the PCB out of a dualshock 4 as well as the touchpad. 

Someone suggested to me that I should try making something smaller. 

Getting Started with the Future Tone Controller
===============================================


Buttons
*******

The keypad features all buttons of a standard dualshock 4 controller minus the analog sticks. It is made to be compatible with Hatsune Miku Project Diva Future Tone as well as Project Diva X. 



Layout Switching
****************

The mode button on the controller lets you switch the layout of the buttons. By pressing and releasing the button, you can change between Arcade and DS4 layout. Arcade layout is made to be similar to the Arcade version of the game if you are used to or prefer the buttons to be in a horizontal orientation. All buttons with the same color are diagonally adjacent to one another so you can still alternate quickly, but it does take some practice to get used to. DS4 layout is identical to the default layout of the DualShock 4.

To avoid confusion, I would recommend resetting the in-game mapping back to default so both modes are correct.


LEDs
****

The LEDs follow the selected layout, so the colors will change depeding on the mode. 

Changing Brightness
*******************

To change the brightness of the LEDs on the controller, hold the mode button and press up or down. This follows the selected layout.

Timeout
*******

Since the controller is using Brook's PS4 Fight Board, Sony may push an update that makes it disconnect after 8 minutes. This can be fixed by updating to the latest firmware from Brook that can be found here:

They are usually very fast to push out updates but you may want to wait a day to update your system just in case.
